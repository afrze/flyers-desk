# Issues faced while creating Auth

- I have faced issue while using `useSelector` not understood the `useSelector`, i have called wrong name of the store, received `undefined` data.
- have to console the `useSelector` so that we will be known how the store is saved with the naming.
- & have faced issue that i have initialized `useSelector` above the `const` it throws an error.
